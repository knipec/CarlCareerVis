What to do when you get new data...


****************  formatData.py  ****************
This takes the original excel file (named "newData.xlsx") with the data and outputs a json file (named "data.json") so the javascript can read it. Majors are also grouped into a smaller number of categories and careers to "Unknown" are not included.

1. If you haven't already, install the xlrd python module:
	- Open Terminal or Command Line
	- Type the following:
			cd path-to-this-folder
			cd xlrd-0.9.2	
			python setup.py install
	- Hopefully that should work. Otherwise the README in the xlrd folder might help. 

2. Open formatData.py in a text editor

3. At the top, if the organization of the excel file has changed, change the dataSource, sheetIndex, etc. accordingly.

4. At the bottom, in the getMajor function:
	- If there are new listed majors that should be on the diagram, add them to the validMajorsList
	- If there are new listed majors that should be considered a different major, add another statement of the following form:
	elif (major == "New listed major"): 
		majorCategories.append("Different major")

5. It should print to the Terminal or Command Line the names of all the listed majors that have been discared. Make sure you wanted all of these to be discarded.

*****************  index.html  ******************
- If a new major category has been added, edit the file. Go to where it says var majorDescriptions = {...} and add the new major category, even if there is no text to display. The format is 
	"Major category name" : "Description"
Or if a new listed major is put under an existing category, add it to the description for that category.
