What to do when you get new data...


****************  formatData.py  ****************
This takes the original excel file (named "newData.xlsx") with the data and outputs a json file (named "data.json") so the javascript can read it. Majors are also grouped into a smaller number of categories and careers to "Unknown" are not included.

1. If you haven't already, install the xlrd python module. (You can find it by searching online. Download it, then follow the installation instructions in its readme.)

2. Open formatData.py in a text editor

3. At the top, if the organization of the excel file has changed, change the dataSource, sheetIndex, etc. accordingly.

4. If there are new majors in the spreadsheet: At the bottom, in the getMajor function:
	- If there are new listed majors that should be on the diagram, add them to the validMajorsList
	- If there are new listed majors that should be considered a different major, add another statement of the following form:
	elif (major == "New listed major"): 
		majorCategories.append("Different major")

5. Run it by typing "python formatData.py" in Terminal or Command Line. It should print out the names of all the listed majors that have been discared. Make sure you wanted all of these to be discarded. (If you're on Windows and it won't run, this may help: http://docs.python.org/2/faq/windows)

*****************  index.html  ******************
- If a new major category has been added, and you want it to have a description when that major is clicked, edit the file. Go to where it says var majorDescriptions = {...} and add the new major category. The format is 
	"Major category name" : "Description"
Or if a new listed major is put under an existing category, add it to the description for that category.
